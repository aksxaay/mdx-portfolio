# Introduction

You might be wondering why I've started a technical blog with an anime character. Now who even watches anime?
Well I happen to really love anime, for all the stoic things it stands to represent. Something I cannot find in humans around me. This blog almost goes solely out to just Vegeta, because of the kind of influence he's had in me.


Background of DBZ and DBZA?
Background of Vegeta?

This was a time where I felt particularly lost, and one of my closest friends in college,Dhruv showed this to me.

I started DBZ for the fun of it, I've been watching anime since 2017 on and off. It's influence has been a good staple in my life so far. But little did I know that although quoted as a kid's show, it had so many values within.

So what does Vegeta stand for? Nothing actually, he only wants to beat Goku. But his resolve is always impressive. Goku was always gifted, naturally as being the protagonist of the show, but Vegeta always surprised by how much Goku exceeds expectations, he pulls feats of his own. and not once has

Vegeta has taught me about pride. You should have pride in the things you do, in the places you come from. There are opinions that make you question all of your decisions at all times, but what is facts is where you are from and what you do, and that is for other people to make sense, and you to stay grounded in.

When my parents sent me to do my College in 2019, this was the biggest discovery I had made.

My parents raised me half the person they wanted to be, but I was still too nice for this world.

It's only after moving out did I realize that they have been protecting me all this while. But it took it's own while to realize that. I for the longest time didn't come to the realization that my parents were on my team, and they've always only wanted what was the best for me.

The cost of my mistake was expensive. It took a huge toll on my parents, on my friends and on me. It was pretty selfish. I simply didn't have the power. The one place where Vegeta would've persevered.

There also one side to this, the whole talk about why Males should embrace, yes. But we can't afford to lose our ground. A part of drive that we muster, comes from that aggressive nature that we've built in us.

I'm aggressive around myself, because it is a new habit. I'm not normalizing it, but I need it to survive. for the last 6 or so months, I've been on straight survive mode. If I don't wake up everyday and do the things that I do, I'm not gonna make it, the world will leave me behind.

I don't approve of this behavior and neither am I normalizing it. I am merely showing that, when you're in a 3rd world country, and you are worried about the next day's food, there's really no time to thing about gender equality and nuclear treaties.
I find myself right there. I can only worry about regular people problems once I get out of here. For which I will have all the patience and discipline to get through.
