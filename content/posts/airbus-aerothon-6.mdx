## Step 1: Resume & Good Luck Charm

Please prepare your resume well.
Have a solid resume. I will not be making a guideline for how to make a resume, but here's what mine looks like - [Akshay's Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hS2rluIZd1WFzt2cxwUGmA8vp4VX2BrI/view?usp=sharing)

I used [FlowCV](https://app.flowcv.com/dashboard) to make this

    {" "}
  </Img>
</Aside>

I did this, and it doesn't hurt to do this whatsoever. The hackerearth page even asks you to send your resume here at `airbusindia.careers@airbus.com`. I did it, you should do it too. 

Maybe.


## Step 2: HackerEarth Test
Time: 2 hours 20 minutes
- 20 MCQ + Short Answer
    - CS Fundamentals 3x3
    - OOPS 3x3
    - Aptitude 3x3
    - SQL 1x4
- 2 Coding Questions (medium)

## Step 3: 24hr Hackathon + Virtual Event**

\*\* This section is merely inferred from the last Aerothon

The main event is called the *Aerothon Finale*, which consists of:
- Hackathon
- Talks
- Meetups
- Gala Event
- Road Show


You'll be doing one of the 2 things during the main event.
- fixing your hackathon code
- exhasted from pulling the all-nighter

however try your best to make notes from the events that unfold, they'll come handy later on during Interviews.

It'll be held on a platform called - [Airmeet](https://www.airmeet.com/)
I personally think it is a beautiful platform, that really makes virtual events fun. I think it was a killer find on Aibus's part.

The last Aerothon (5.0) still has the airmeet agenda up and running if you want to take a look - [Aerothon 5.0 Event | Airmeet](https://www.airmeet.com/e/fe9ae8c0-e8d0-11ed-b8ab-037cf9e9647f)

You will simply be able to attend the hackathon upon just participating.
You will receive the nomination for hackathon results on May 10.

You have to immediately form teams of 3 - 5\*\*, the team members need to have been selected for the hackathon, so don't forget to bring your A team.
Hackathon format - 24 hour\*\*

The problem statement would be handed to you a day before the Finale (Evaluation + Main Event).

Although you will be extremely exhausted, please pay attention to what other teams present, if you're given the opportunity.

## Step 4: Waiting

You do get e-mails in between that you have to pay **attention** to. Even though you have given all possible details, Airbus sends a good number of emails that require following up.


## Step 5: Prep Time

To Airbus's credit, I'm really glad they gave me that prep time of a week.
I was able to brush up all my CS Fundamentals, and **really read** what was written on my resume. Yeah, you heard that right, even I didn't remember, what I had given on my own resume.

Because you have to remember
- Resume Submit - April
- Interview - June

In these 2 months had a whole another project ready by the time the interviews were scheduled.

Before you start studying anything advanced, remember:

Interviewer only asks you what you've mentioned on your resume.
Order your skills and projects in **descending order** of your confidence with it.

Eg: 
Skills: React, Javascript

on youtube, look up : 
2. "\<insert skill \> crash course" (if not confident in topic)
1. "\<insert skill\> interview questions" (once you are familiar)

I truly gave those 7 days my all, don't think I studied any harder for anything else. I also remember it was the week where my college announced my final semester result, and the combined CGPA had made my Mom cry. Sigh.


## Step 6: Technical Interview

Duration: 30 minutes\*\*

These where the questions I was asked.

- Introduce Yourself
- What are access specifiers?
- Explain how inheritance would work between the access specifiers
- What are constructors? What kinds of constructors exist?
- Objects vs Classes?
- What is a final class (OOPS)?
- Difference between break and continue and give an example.
- If in  while loop you encounter return what happens? What happens in case of in a function? (asked about `return 0` in `int main()`)
- Linear Search vs Binary Search
- Describe one Machine Learning Algorithm
- Give real life example of relationship in SQL.
- Creatively come up with a way python can be used in Airbus.
- What are the 3 pillars of Airbus? (not core values)

I'll be honest, I did not get all the questions right.
Didn't know what a final class was, didn't know the 3 pillars of Airbus (I still don't lmao). But I did not **NOT** **answer** a single one.
The interviewer will also try their best to make sure you understood the questions correctly. 

Eg:- I misunderstood the return statement question, so I answered something correct, but not to the question. They were kind enough clear out the misunderstanding.

**ALWAYS** ask if the your answer satisfies their question - this is to avoid misintepreting questions, but not if you answer is wrong.

If you're unsure, be confident that you're unsure.
".. I'm not too sure, however, I think it is ...".

**Don't stop trying.**

And *one pro tip*.

Actually *care* about the questions asked.

I definitely asked the interviewer right after the interview what the answer was to the ones I knew I missed. (I still don't know remember the Airbus pillars lmao).

This shows that you care about **feedback**, and are actually curious about the subject.

Here are the portions you need to be fairly familiar with (if you're from CS background)

- CS Fundamentals
- Operating Systems OS
- Computer Networks CN
- Database Management Systems DBMS
- Object Oriented Programming OOPS

Outside of these, it is mostly general in nature, if you're from a Non-CS background, they will tone down on the difficulty of the questions, but do come prepared on the above concepts.

Airbus has so far only asked questions that were on the resume.
If you have `DS Algo` on the resume, expect DS Algo questions / solving.
Basically rank your skills on the resume in the **descending order of confidence**.

If you refer to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hS2rluIZd1WFzt2cxwUGmA8vp4VX2BrI/view?usp=sharing) I personally went for the `DEV` route, as I simply was not comfortable with showcasing my DS Algo capabilities. Pick your strongest weapon wisely.

If you've done your best on the prep time before your interview, you only have thing to now do.

**HYPE YOURSELF UP!**

<Aside position="right">
  <Img
    src={`/aerothon-6/brick-talk.jpeg`}
    bleed={false}
    width={1200}
    height={900}
    caption="Talk to yourself!"
  >
    {" "}
  </Img>
</Aside>

I'm not joking. There was a mindset that I had brought myself to believe, where I could've moved mountains or even KO'd Muhammad Ali. The amount of controlled narcissism that I put into myself was insane. 
I literally felt like a god 5 minutes before the interview.

PS. This only works for low confidence introverts, do not ever come off as cocky. You only need to feel unstoppable.

## Step 7: HR + Head Of Department Round

Duration: 30 minutes\*\*

This is basically the behavioural round, where you are accompanied by an HR, and a Head of any of the Departments.

You are basically tested for pretty much 2 things:
- Communication Proficiency \ Competency
- Intent of joining Airbus

You are tested for your ability to communicate ideas across, and listen for inputs.
- Learn to clarify if you've misunderstood anything that the interviewer is telling you. 
- Do not hesitate to make them repeat it.
- Don't monologue, or give one word answers. Keep the answers brief, to the point, and about *a minute* long 


These were the questions I was asked.
- <span style={{color:'orangered'}}>Introduce yourself and your family background?</span> (take as much time as you need)
- Take us through your Resume
- Difference between React and Javascript?
- What are your strengths in a project?
- <span style={{color:'orangered'}}>Why do you want to join Airbus?</span>
- Would you be okay if we gave you a different role than what you prefer?
- Plans 5 years from now?
- Recent display of Teamwork / Leadership / Conflict Resolution
- <span style={{color:'orangered'}}>Do you have any questions for us?</span>

**Do not ever** leave a question unturned. All questions are in-place for a reason. Don't be like Kavya below:

    bleed={false}
    width={1200}
    height={900}
    caption="Kavya is a dude friend of mine, don't be like Kavya!"
/>


Here's how I cleared these.

The questions I've marked in <span style={{color:'orangered'}}>orange</span> are the most important ones is according to me of the utmost importance. They always ask that question in multiple forms, which is why please go through this video by Mike. 

<span style={{color:'orangered'}}>"Tell Me About Yourself"</span>
- [Tell Me About Yourself | Job Ready English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jN0lpOTIK0)
- [Tell Me About Yourself Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I581sWq4X0M)
This is where you get to show your charisma, character development, maturity.

<span style={{color:'orangered'}}>"Why do you want to join Airbus"?</span>

You can be honest.
Think deep about how what you're doing ties in with Airbus.

You could be thinking, "Damn, I work in XYZ field unrelated to Airbus, what do I say." 
**Get creative.**

I didn't come from an Aerospace background, yet I had 2 unique things going for me.
- College had an Aerospace Dept.
- I had friends in Aerospace Engineering.

*" ... Although I come from a CS Background ... a huge part of my college culture was all about Aerospace ... we have a decommmissioned MIG 21 on display ... Kalpana Chawla is our esteemed alumni ... "*

"... Engineering is all about tolerancing, and aerospace has the strictest standards of them all, due to the amount of lives involved ... I initially had minimal interest ... however seeing my friends in aerospace, such motivated and talented individuals ... work day and night with marginal returns ... "

*" ... Countless nights they come to my room discussing about supersonic flow, what is the difference between a ramjet and a scramjet, grid independence test (the ML / AI hype of their domain), cryogenic engines, the list is endless ... "*

" ... this is also how I found out Boeing uses Phillips head screws, and Airbus uses offset screws ..."

" ... Don't get me wrong, I am very much interested in my domain and what I do, but watching their dedication and passion move them, puts me in such awe ... How can one not build mutual trust and admiration for such an industry that has such wonderful people ... "

<Aside position="left">

    width={1200}
    height={900}
    caption="Don't stop"

    {" "}
  </Img>
</Aside>

" ... **If these are the kinda talented individuals that Aerospace and Airbus attracts** and **I am also allowed to focus on my own domain**, where else would I want to be? ... ".

The menu is limitless, all you have to do is cook.

I honestly at that felt the achievement of the verbal equivalent of *sweeping someone off their feet*. I literally felt that **Preparation met Opportunity type Luck** moment right there.

<span style={{color:'orangered'}}>"Do you have any questions for us?"</span>
Yes, you do? did you really just figure out everything about this job already?
You have to convince yourself that you already got employed.

- "Can you share more about the roles you guys are looking for?"
- "What is your personal favourite part about working in Airbus?"
- "Are there any concerns you have regarding my candidacy?"
- "If I do get selected, what would you like me to bring to the table?"
- "Can I get an honest feedback about the interview I've given so far?"

The last three questions are literally a litmus test for the interviewer's confidence in you. That aside, these are the questions that will ground you back to reality. Especially after you've brought yourself to an elevated state of confidence to counter the nervousness of giving one of these interviews.



Definitely give the following topics a thought as well. You have to come across as charismatic and interesting. So think about these and have answers prepared for them. I have cited some of my personal examples for reference.
- Personal Background
- Fun facts about yourself
    - My government name is literally Akshay Kumar.
    - I can type at 130 wpm. (subtle flex)
    - I write my personal diary which gets frequently pushed to Github. (no you cannot fork it)
- Routine (productive)
- Achievements - Personal and Professional.
- Motivation / Drive - what makes you get up in the morning, for years to come.
    - I wrote about how I strive to achieve Ikigai (balance)
    - A person that people can count on during hard times.
    - Provide a community to people that don't fully belong, like it was once provided to me.
- Strengths and Weaknesses
- Failures (and how you've overcome it)

Finally one final video by Mike again. - [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msxQl8IYPW0)

Please keep in mind th STAR format with which you can prepare a script for all your answers.
