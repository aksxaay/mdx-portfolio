### One Piece

Here's a quote from Vegeta in **DBZ**

> "Only a Failure Abandons His Principles and Pride."

**Vegeta vs Jiren**

> "You may have invaded my mind and my body, but there's one thing a Saiyan always keeps: his pride."

**Possessed Vegeta**

> "Let me ask you: Does a machine like yourself ever experience fear?"

Android 19

> "Is it slavery when you get what you want?"

Possessed Vegeta

> "You say I'm arrogant. I say, damn right. That's pride. Pride in the Saiyan I am."
> Based Vegeta

well yeah they're on the side, but that's fucking awesome man.
