# Introduction

Hi my name is Akshay Kumar Ragavan. I'm a CS Undergrad that has design tendencies.

I'm a <span style={{color: "violet"}}>jack of all trades</span> code generalist that dabbles in various technolgies.

As an avid Linux Enjoyer. This post is dedicated to my <span style={{color: "#86BE43"}}>Linux Mint</span> machine,which I've been using as my daily driver since 2019. It has been incredibly patient with me through my ignorance, and has never let me down during times of need.

It's crazy to think that I'll have a CS degree by the time anyone reads this.

Currently, I'm enjoying working on <span style={{color: "violet"}}>**Web Development**</span> projects.

In my free time I enjoy journalling, practicing [typing tests](https://monkeytype.com/profile/sidejua) (130 + WPM btw) trying out new Linux distributions, or playing football (no its not called soccer). Lately, I've developed an appreciation for solving problems related to data structures and algorithms.

Here are some of the domains I have projects and opinions on:

- **Web Development (current)**
  - FrontEnd (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Typescript, ReactJS, Next.js, Redux)
  - BackEnd (Node.js, Express, REST API, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, Docker)
- **Linux Administration**
  - Distributions (Debian, Arch)
  - QEMU / KVM Virtualization
  - Shell Scripting & Automation
  - System Monitoring and Logging
- **Design**
  - Adobe Suite
    - Video (After Effects, Premiere Pro, Media Encoder)
    - Raster & Vector Processinng (Photoshop, Illustrator)
    - Audio (Audition)
  - Blender 3D, C4D.
- **Blockchain**
  - NFTs, DeFi, DAOs
  - ERC Tokens
  - Infura
  - dApps
  - ethers.js
  - L2 and Rollups
- **UI / UX**
  - Figma
  - UX Patterns
  - Color Theory
- **CyberSecurity**
  - Cryptography
  - Operating Systems
  - Networking (Wi-Fi)
  - Virtualization

## Backstory

Ever since I was young, I was always fascinated by how things worked, I would try and take apart my toys and put them back together, or build my own contraptions using the parts lying around the house.

The older I grew, the more I started gravitating towards computers and software.
I was definitely more interested in Computer Games for the longest time, but I learned to find joy in delving into more technical depths, experimenting with designs animations, and pushing the limits of what traditional machines can do.

But beyond technical aspects I saw the impact that it had on my life even if it is a bubble when young. I saw how it was slowly empowering all the things that I did, and started to contribute a real difference in people's lives. I was drawn to this sense of purpose, and felt a deep desire to break barriers in this field.

### Foray into Design

I very vividly remember one fine day coming across a particular edit of a certain game, and it captivated me so much upto the point where I spent the next 2 years perfecting my craft on Digital Video Medium, Everything from Digital camera work, Time and Keyframe interpolation, Animations, Typography, 3D Modelling, Abstract Design etc. I still have my works from that era, feel free to check [@juanweeb](https://www.instagram.com/juanweeb/) out on Instagram.

### Computer Hardware

I was always quite serious about my hobbies. I eventually managed to save up and built my Ryzen machine so I can take up editing further, as I ran into hardware limitations pretty early on. She was born on the 13th of April 2019, and was an absolute beast for her time.

- AMD Ryzen 2600 (6C / 12T) 3.4 Ghz
- MSI GTX 1070Ti
- 16GB DDR4 3200Mhz T-Force Delta
- Asus ROG Strix B450
- HP EX950 NVME - 512GB
- Seagate Barracuda - 2TB
- Cooler Master 3 Fan MB520

### First taste of Code

I had to say my final words to this hobby that served me for so long as I eventually started pursuing a CS degree.

But the more major things that pushed me to code basically were:

- Subpar Experience on Windows. (I rage wiped installed Linux almost 4 years ago).
- Realized Adobe's Scripting Engine and Language was actually inspired by Javascript.

I've been doing development for close to 2 years now, and as someone who is very oriented towards visual feedback of progress, I naturally gravitated towards web development. Websites is also easily one of the most prominent and accessible forms of media available.

I have created this blog for the sole purpose of documenting my Coding Journey, so don't be surprised if I'm not writing too much about it in this one.

Stay tuned for more Posts :)
