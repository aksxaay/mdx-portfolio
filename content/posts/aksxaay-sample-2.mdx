  <Img
    src={createOgImage({
      title: variables.title,
      meta: variables.meta,
    })}
    width={1600}
    height={836}

  <Img
    caption="Generated image"
    src={createOgImage({

<Aside position="right" styled={true}>
  The path we send to Cloudinary must form a valid URL. Arguments are separated
  by commas: `w_1600,h_836,q_100`. Transformation layers can be chained and are
  separated by slashes: `w_1600,h_836,q_100/grain.png`

only using this for fairly important quotations

```py
print('Hello World')
```

so basically mardown flies in here

I'm a big fan of [Josh Comeau's work](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). The like button on his blog is one of the most delightful UI elements I've come across. It's also a deceptively complex component (I honestly thought I could re-implement it in an hour, haha) that contains an SVG, sounds, mouse tracking, animations and of course, exploding confetti. 🎉

### Vegeta Quotes

Here's a quote from Vegeta in **DBZ**

> "Only a Failure Abandons His Principles and Pride."

**Vegeta vs Jiren**

> "You may have invaded my mind and my body, but there's one thing a Saiyan always keeps: his pride."

**Possessed Vegeta**

> "Let me ask you: Does a machine like yourself ever experience fear?"

Android 19

> "Is it slavery when you get what you want?"

Possessed Vegeta

> "You say I'm arrogant. I say, damn right. That's pride. Pride in the Saiyan I am."
> Based Vegeta

well yeah they're on the side, but that's fucking awesome man.
