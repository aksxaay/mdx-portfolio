## Final Blog Quest

Somewhere in the middle I ended up discovering a game-changing tool - [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)

> Contentlayer is a **content SDK** that validates and transforms your content into **type-safe** JSON data

Easily one of the most game-changing DX (Developer Experience) I've had, right up there with Next.js and tailwindcss.

They have one banger conte nt blog that fully explains why working with content is hard for developers

### H3

also generate some content

<FauxTweet>
  Okay this is a sample text between FauxTweet but what if I add more text lorem
  ipsum{" "}
</FauxTweet>

<FauxTweet>
  <Img
    src={createOgImage({
      title: variables.title,
      meta: variables.meta,
    })}
    width={1600}
    height={836}
  />
</FauxTweet>

<Aside position="left">
  <Img
    caption="Generated image"
    src={createOgImage({
      title: variables.title,
      meta: variables.meta,
    })}
    width={1600}
    height={836}
  />
</Aside>

<Aside position="right" styled={true}>
  The path we send to Cloudinary must form a valid URL. Arguments are separated
  by commas: `w_1600,h_836,q_100`. Transformation layers can be chained and are
  separated by slashes: `w_1600,h_836,q_100/grain.png`

only using this for fairly important quotations

```py
print('Hello World')
```

so basically mardown flies in here

I'm a big fan of [Josh Comeau's work](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). The like button on his blog is one of the most delightful UI elements I've come across. It's also a deceptively complex component (I honestly thought I could re-implement it in an hour, haha) that contains an SVG, sounds, mouse tracking, animations and of course, exploding confetti. ðŸŽ‰

### What's Next

been planning to add a comments section if time permits, and probably streamline some of the internal process that takes to render this blog?
